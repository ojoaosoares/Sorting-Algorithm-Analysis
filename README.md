# Sorting Algorithm Analysis

This project implements and experimentally analyzes classic sorting algorithms, comparing their real-world performance against theoretical time complexities learned in the *Data Structures* course at UFMG.

## ✅ Implemented Algorithms
- **Quadratic (O(n²))**: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort  
- **Log-linear (O(n log n))**: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Shell Sort  
- **Linear / Non-comparative (O(n))**: Counting Sort, Bucket Sort, Radix Sort  

## ✅ Project Structure
- `./src` — source files  
- `./include` — header files  
- `Makefile` — build automation  
  - `make all` → builds into `./bin/a.out`  
  - `make clean` → removes binaries and objects  

## ✅ How to Compile
```bash
make
